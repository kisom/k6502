K6502

In preparation for eventually building an Apple //c emulator on an AVR
platform, I'm working on building an emulator first. My C++ skills are
terribly rusty. It's something to hack on when I need a break from other
projects.

This is so far from being anything useful, you are advised to stay far
away.

K6502 is Kyle's 6502.
